I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Yanbin Pan](https://mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~yanbinpan/), and I am expected to graduate in 2027. I also spent one year with the [Crypto Group](https://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/) at Aarhus University, hosted by [Diego F. Aranha](https://dfaranha.github.io/). My research interests lie primarily in the application of Algorithmic Number Theory and Combinatorics to problems in Cryptography and Theoretical Computer Science. I prefer problems with a strong mathematical structure, such as those with an algebraic or combinatorial flavor.
