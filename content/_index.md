ⓗⓔⓛⓛⓞ! (👍≖‿‿≖)👍 👍(≖‿‿≖👍)

Now I am a first-year PhD student under the guidance of [Yanbin Pan](https://mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~yanbinpan/). My research interests primarily revolve around Algorithms \& Theory, particularly in **Lattice-based Cryptography** and **Succinct Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.

Currently, I am visiting the [Crypto Group](https://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/) in Aarhus University from October 2024 to October 2025, hosted by [Diego F. Aranha](https://dfaranha.github.io/).

### Selected Publications

ヾ(＾∇＾) Some of my favourite results:

- **Computing Asymptotic Bounds for Small Roots in Coppersmith's Method via Sumset Theory.** [[PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1330)][[CODE](https://github.com/fffmath/AsymptoticBounds)]\
By introducing the Sumsets theory from Additive Combinatorics as a new analytical tool, we develop the first provable algorithm for determining these asymptotic bounds, which significantly streamlines manual calculations. 

- **Small Public Exponent Brings More: Improved Partial Key Exposure Attacks against RSA.** *CIC'24* [[PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1329)][[CODE](https://github.com/fffmath/MSBsOfPrivateKeyAttack)]\
We improve the attack by Boneh et al. at Asiacrypt '98 and achieve a 2^10 (or 1,024) x improvement in the running time for e = 65,537.

- **Embedding Integer Lattices as Ideals into  Polynomial Rings.** *ISSAC'24* [[PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1041)][[CODE](https://github.com/fffmath/IdentifyIdealLattice)]\
An algorithm to verify whether a given full-rank lattice in Z^n is an ideal lattice and output all the polynomial rings.
