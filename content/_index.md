Now I am a PhD student under the guidance of [Yanbin Pan](https://mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~yanbinpan/).  
My research interests primarily focus on using Algorithmic Number Theory and Combinatorics to solve problems in Cryptography.  
I prefer problems that have a mathematical structure, such as an algebraic or combinatorial flavor.  

Together with my collaborators, we introduced additive combinatorics into Coppersmith's method, which allowed us to avoid manual calculations of success conditions.  
This result was accepted to Crypto'25, and we also have some interesting applications and follow-up work.  

Currently, I am interested in leakage-resilient secret sharing, not only in terms of lower bounds but also in proving security.  
I particularly enjoy the Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics tools used in this area.  

**I am currently looking for a postdoc.**



### Selected Publications

„Éæ(Ôºæ‚àáÔºæ) Some of my favourite results ([A full list of publications](/publications/)):

- **Computing Asymptotic Bounds for Small Roots in Coppersmith's Method via Sumset Theory.** *Crypto'25* [[PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1330)][[CODE](https://github.com/fffmath/AsymptoticBounds)]\
By introducing the Sumsets theory from Additive Combinatorics as a new analytical tool, we develop the first provable algorithm for determining these asymptotic bounds, which significantly streamlines manual calculations. 

- **Small Public Exponent Brings More: Improved Partial Key Exposure Attacks against RSA.** *CIC'24* [[PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1329)][[CODE](https://github.com/fffmath/MSBsOfPrivateKeyAttack)]\
We improve the attack by Boneh et al. at Asiacrypt '98 and achieve a 2^10 (or 1,024) x improvement in the running time for e = 65,537.

- **Embedding Integer Lattices as Ideals into  Polynomial Rings.** *ISSAC'24* [[PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1041)][[CODE](https://github.com/fffmath/IdentifyIdealLattice)]\
An algorithm to verify whether a given full-rank lattice in Z^n is an ideal lattice and output all the polynomial rings.
